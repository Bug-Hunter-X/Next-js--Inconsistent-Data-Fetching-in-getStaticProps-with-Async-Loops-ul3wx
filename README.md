# Next.js Inconsistent Data Fetching in getStaticProps with Async Loops

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in Next.js applications when using `getStaticProps` with dynamic routes and asynchronous data fetching within loops.  Improper handling of asynchronous operations can lead to incomplete or inconsistent data across pages.

## Problem
When fetching data for multiple items within `getStaticProps` using an asynchronous operation in a loop, there's a risk that the data may not be completely fetched before the page is rendered. This leads to inconsistent and partially rendered content.

## Solution
The solution involves using `Promise.all` to ensure all asynchronous operations within the loop are completed before continuing.  `Promise.all` waits for all the promises to resolve before returning a single array of resolved values.

## How to reproduce
Clone the repo and run `npm install`. Then, start the development server with `npm run dev`.  Navigate to different dynamic routes to observe the inconsistencies in the initial render. After implementing the fix in `bugSolution.js`, the inconsistencies will disappear.
