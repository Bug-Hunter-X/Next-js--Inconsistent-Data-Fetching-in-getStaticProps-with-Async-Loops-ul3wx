In Next.js, a subtle issue can arise when using `getStaticProps` or `getStaticPaths` with dynamic routes and a complex data fetching process.  If your data fetching involves asynchronous operations within a loop (like fetching data for each item in an array), and you don't handle them correctly with `Promise.all`, you might encounter unexpected behavior.  Specifically, the data might be incomplete or inconsistent across pages, leading to rendering errors or missing content. This happens because `getStaticProps` expects to receive all the necessary data before rendering the page, and asynchronous operations within a loop that aren't properly awaited may resolve out of order or only partially.
